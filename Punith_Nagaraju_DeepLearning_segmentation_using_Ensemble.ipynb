        "**Step 5: Boosting Ensemble Training and Prediction:** This section introduces the concept of a 'Boosting' ensemble. It sets up a sequential training process for multiple models (using a unet_resnet18 configuration). In a typical boosting scenario, subsequent models focus on correcting errors made by previous models. While the notebook's implementation for weight calculation is a simplified placeholder, it trains models sequentially and saves them. Subsequently, it loads these boosting models and performs an ensemble prediction on a batch of data, calculating and displaying metrics like Dice score and visualizing the result."

        "**Step 6: Stacking Ensemble Training and Prediction**: This part of the notebook focuses on the 'Stacking' ensemble. It trains several base models (UNet, DeepLabV3+, UNetPlusPlus, LinkNet) individually, similar to the initial bagging phase, and saves them. The primary goal of stacking is to use the predictions of these base models as 'meta-features' for a meta-learner (which would then learn to combine them). In the current notebook, the prediction phase for stacking simplifies this by directly averaging the outputs of these base models, similar to bagging, and evaluates its performance."

Through this detailed examination, we aim to provide a clear understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each method and their combined efficacy in addressing the challenges of medical image analysis."
